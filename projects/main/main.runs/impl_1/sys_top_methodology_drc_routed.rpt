2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks camera_clock and clk_pll_i are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks camera_clock] -to [get_clocks clk_pll_i]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks camera_clock and hdmi_pix_clk_wiz_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks camera_clock] -to [get_clocks hdmi_pix_clk_wiz_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks camera_clock and clk_pll_i are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks camera_clock] -to [get_clocks clk_pll_i]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks camera_clock and hdmi_pix_clk_wiz_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks camera_clock] -to [get_clocks hdmi_pix_clk_wiz_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks camera_clock and clk_pll_i are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#2 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks camera_clock and hdmi_pix_clk_wiz_1 are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#3 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks hdmi_pix_clk_wiz_1 and clk_pll_i are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks hdmi_pix_clk_wiz_1 and clk_pll_i are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) io_camera_sda direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (io_camera_sda) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '6' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
